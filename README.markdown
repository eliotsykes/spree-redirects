= Redirects extension for Spree
[http://github.com/eliotsykes/spree-redirects](http://github.com/eliotsykes/spree-redirects)

An extension for managing redirects within Spree.  Useful if you're migrating
old urls for a previous store to a new store and you or users
want to be able to do it without touching the server config files.

Once you've created a redirect, you can test it from the redirect listings
screen.

Thanks to [http://www.pinvoke.com/](http://www.pinvoke.com/) for the direction sign icon.

See the screengrab files in this directory so you know what you'll get if you install:

Good luck, feedback and contributions welcome.
