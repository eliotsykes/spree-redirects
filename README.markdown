= Redirects extension for Spree
[http://github.com/eliotsykes/spree-redirects]

An extension for managing redirects within Spree.  Useful if you're migrating
old urls for a previous store to a new store and you or users
want to be able to do it without touching the server config files.

Once you've created a redirect, you can test it from the redirect listings
screen.

Thanks to [http://www.pinvoke.com/] for the direction sign icon.

Here's a couple of screengrabs so you know what you'll get if you install:

![Redirects listing](/redirects-listing.png "Redirects listing")

![New redirect](/new-redirect.png "New redirect")

Good luck, feedback and contributions welcome.
